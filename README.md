A tool that analyzes GIT Repositories and estimates the defect probability of Software components to help developers
focusing their resources to fix bugs where they really are. We are currently supporting method granularity for Java.

*Schwa is under heavy development as a Master Thesis and is only available as pre-release on the Python Package Index.*
 

## Install
`pip3.4 install schwa --pre`

 or
 
`python3.4 setup.py install`

## Usage
Command line:

```shell
usage: schwa [-h] [--commits COMMITS] repository

Predicts defects from GIT repositories.

positional arguments:
  repository         repository full path on local file system

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --commits COMMITS  maximum number of commits, since the last one, to be
                     analyzed

```python
from schwa import Schwa
s = Schwa(repository_path)
analytics = s.analyze()
```

## Test
