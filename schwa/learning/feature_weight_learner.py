    """ Learns features weights.

    Schwa uses Revisions, Fixes and Authors as metrics to compute defect probabilities. This class helps finding
    the weights of each feature, formulating this as an optimization problem where the search strategy is using
    Genetic Algorithms. An individual is encoded like {revisions_weights, fixes_weight, authors_weight}. For example,
    using 2 bits precisions: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1] = { 2/3, 0, 1/3}. See self.fitness() to understand how fitness is
    computed.

    Attributes:
        BITS_PRECISION: An int with the default value for bits precision.
        FEATURES: An int with the number of features.
        GENERATIONS: An int with the default value for the number of generations.
        FEATURES: An int with the number of features.
        repo: An instance of Repository.
        deap_toolbox: An instance of DEAP toolbox to use GA.
        constraints: A list of constraints individuals must respect.
        bits: An int with the bits precision.
        generations: An int with the number of generations.
        population: An int with the initial population.
